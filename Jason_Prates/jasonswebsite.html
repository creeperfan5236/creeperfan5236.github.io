<h1> Welcome to my minecraft website!</h1>
<p> <b>Minecraft</b> is an awesome game where you craft blocks to create whatever your mind can imagine! But be careful though, because at night monsters come out like skeletons, zombies, endermen, spiders, ghasts, and the worst of all creepers. But that's just some of them. So let me run you through what minecraft is.</p>
<lb>
<h1 style="color:#08FF3A">My Top five favorite 
monsters from Minecraft.</h1><ol>
<li> Creeper (they explode and if they get struck by lightning, their explosion gets increased by alot and more damage to your home!)
<li> Endermen (They can teleport and the can pick up blocks if it is light enough.)
<li> Zombie Pigmen (They are pigmen but they are zombies with golden swords and they drop gold!)
<li> Zombie (They make growling sounds and they can be scary when they break down your door.)
<li> Spider jockey (It is a skeleton riding a spider and they have double health and double damage.)
<p> The <i>bad</i> things about this game is that there is <span style="color:aqua">water</span>,
<span style="color:red">lava</span>,and <span style="color:orange">fire</span>,doesnt seem bad right? Well you can drown if you stay under water for too long, lava and fire you obviously get burnt, Unless your on creative mode, then you never die. One thing I hate about creative mode is that if you break through bedrock (and you can) you can fall and fall and fall then eventually die. If you are curious to see what minecraft is like then look at this! <img src="http://www.gearfuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/MinecraftServer060809-500x298.png" width="250" height="200" alt="Minecraft rules!" /><p> <q>(I've gotten the image from google.This is also called Minecraft Classic.

<p> So you may be thinking, What was the basic history of Minecraft? Well, the answer is really simple. The guy who made minecraft was Markus Persson. His minecraft name is Notch. Where was it made? Well let me tell you, the company Mojang is located in Stockholm, Sweden. Just like this website, Minecraft is all coding made through Java. Finally, why was minecraft made? The thing is the are thousands of reasons why it was made. For example, It could be for building, or for survival type people, or just for 8 bit graphics if you like that.<p>

<p> here are some 8-bit designs made in Minecraft!<p>
